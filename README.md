HOW TO WRITE A TEST:
----------Unit Testing----------------------------------------
Act as a norrmal user :
how this appln is running 
how appln should responding


e.g:for backend
desctibe("when sum function is called",()=>{
    describe("with two positive value", ()=>{
        expect(sum(2,3).toBe(5))
    }

})

it can be negative too
